This is a small database for students written in c. I have written this program for educational goals. In this program you can do insertion of new students, deletion, update, display. After entering the data to the database and after closing the program the data will be saved in a file. When you reopen the program, the informations stored in the database will be automatically read, so that you can manipulate them. This program contains some bugs, that I should fix in the next days.  This program was developped under linux.
